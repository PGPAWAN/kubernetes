Taints in added to node and Tolerations on pods.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Taints
++++++++++
Restrict nodes for specific pods only..it doesn't allow scheduler to create other pods on it.

Master Node : is default taint with specific feature so that application pods won't run on it .


Use kubectl taint nodes command to taint a node.

Syntax

$ kubectl taint nodes <node-name> key=value:taint-effect
Example

$ kubectl taint nodes node1 app=blue:NoSchedule
The taint effect defines what would happen to the pods if they do not tolerate the taint.

There are 3 taint effects

NoSchedule
PreferNoSchedule
NoExecute

Tolerations
++++++++++++++

Tolerations are added to pods by adding a tolerations section in pod definition.
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
 name: myapp-pod
spec:
 containers:
 - name: nginx-container
   image: nginx
 tolerations:
 - key: "app"
   operator: "Equal"
   value: "blue"
   effect: "NoSchedule"

Taints and Tolerations do not tell the pod to go to a particular node. Instead, they tell the node to only accept pods with certain tolerations.
   To see this taint, run the below command
   $ kubectl describe node kubemaster |grep Taint



kubectl explain pod --recursive  | less
kubectl explain pod --recursive  | grep -A5 tolerations
